## This app lets you explore Divvy bikes.
  Click <a href="https://divvy-explorer.herokuapp.com"> here </a> to see what it currently looks like.
 This web app was what I originally came up with when we had about 1.5 days to design something
"meaningful and beautiful at dbc".
 From time to time, I will add some more functionality to it and also update this README periodically. Feel free to leave comments on any suggestions
 you have. follow on twitter @mark_amobi.

Below, are some of the things currently on the site:

- You can see all stations, select specific stations.

- For a particular station, you can see live info for status of docks and bikes of that station.

-  Also you can see a google map centered around the specific station.

- You can see a high-chart graph which gives you a rough idea of what the number of bikes is for all stations.

### TODO
- add feature for user to select 2 divvy stations and be able to see suggested routes and estimated time for trip.

- add heatmap for visualization showing availability of bikes at stations and availability of empty docks.

- style map based on experience from twitter final project app.

- somehow incooperate twitter stream because why not?

- maybe add oauth?

- maybe attempt to do this in rails?

- maybe attempt to redo app using node JS.

- Think of any other feature that can be added to this.
