## This app lets you explore Divvy bikes.
  Click <a href="https://divvy-explorer.herokuapp.com"> here </a> to see what it currently looks like.
 This web app was what I originally came up with when we had about 1.5 days to design something
"meaningful and beautiful at dbc".
 From time to time, I will add some more functionality to it and also update this README periodically. Feel free to leave comments on any suggestions
 you have.

Below, are some of the things currently on the site:

- You can see all stations, select specific stations.

- For a particular station, you can see live info for status of docks and bikes of that station.

-  Also you can see a google map centered around the specific station.

- You can see a high-chart graph which gives you a rough idea of what the number of bikes is for all stations.

### TODO
